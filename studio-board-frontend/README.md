# Studio Board

## Overview

Studio Board is a media and production job board app that connects industry professionals with opportunities, including job openings, volunteering, networking events, access to film premieres, and festivals. It serves as a hub for filmmakers, creatives, and production professionals to find work, collaborate, and grow their networks within the film, media, and entertainment industry.

### Problem Space

### User Profile

Studio Board will be used by filmmakers, actors, crew members, content creators, media professionals, entertainment agencies, and marketing/advertising firms looking to hire talent or find industry opportunities. Employers, production companies, and event organizers can use the platform to post job openings, volunteer opportunities, and networking events.
